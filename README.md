# do-something
Skills Lab Week 6


INSTALLATION:
-This open-source program can be installed by downloading the git repository from my GitHub page.
-The program can then be run by running the .ipynb file in the JupyterHub kernel or other equivalent.

USAGE:
-This program is quite simple. After executing do_things.ipynb, the script will prompt you to enter a few responses
after which it will execute some code and return a series of text.
-The program should not be used for any means deemed inappropriate for the work environment.(more details in CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

CONTRIBUTION:
-Any new submissions for additional updates to the code (much appreciated!) should be added to the directory through pull request where they will be pulled and reviewed for functionality. Other contributors should proofread the code for other issues and communicate those before the next commit and push to live. Any disputes will always be communicated back resolved with a compromise.
-New files to the directory should always come with complete documentation and a list of invariants before a pull request is sent.

DOC:
This program will suggest that the user of the program joins my group because i am alone :(
The program takes a name and the favorite number of the user to do this :/
The group consists of just me, ijb10, at the moment
